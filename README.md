# Go snake!

This is just a small project I made in an afternoon just to write something in Golang, a great language that I love!
It's a simple snake game that uses the [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) library to build the user interface and so the game itself.

I implemented some cool options to like the speed selection and the "pacman effect" (that allows you to go through walls and end up on the other side, not related to any flat earth conspiracy).

##### Have fun!

If you are a master gopher and you notice some mistake or you just want to give me some coding advice, feel free to create an issue! I'm always happy to learn something!
